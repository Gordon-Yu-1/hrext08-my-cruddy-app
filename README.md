Read and looked up documentation for a library which creates maps. Didnt have any luck implementing it. Al though I feel I am close;

Ideas for final project. 

Create a list of countries you have visited and ones you hope to visit. 
	-use a library similar to C3 or even use C3 and create a graph of some sort instead of a map
	- attempted to use mapael but had no luck getting it to work
	- next will attempt to use twism

Shade them different colors. 
	-different shades for countries you want to visit and countries you have visited

Update would be when you have visited a new country
	-Once you have visited a country change the color to the visit color

Delete would be if there is a country you wanted to visit but have changed your mind. 
	-Maybe thereâ€™s a country you no longer wish to visit

Create would be a new country you hope to visit
	-create a list of countries you would like to visit
	-maybe a priority sequence with a down or upvote

Could take you to a link with the wiki on that country
	-offer a link to the countries wiki

Libraries
	-Jquery
	-Raphael
	-Mapael
	-twism
